# decision-assistant-roundtrip-demo
A read-only demonstration repo for Decision Assistant. Shows a full server roundtrip evidence flow: REQUIRE_CONFIRM → EXECUTE → REJECT, including receipts, plan_hash validation, and CI-verifiable output. This is not the product source code.

# Decision Assistant

A Cursor **MCP server** that enforces deterministic **decision guardrails** for risky engineering actions.
It does not “review” your code. It interrupts execution **at decision time** and emits a verifiable, machine-readable
**evidence payload** (including a confirmation receipt when required).

- Deterministic rules (no LLM required)
- Guardrail modes: `ALLOW` / `REQUIRE_CONFIRM` / `BLOCK`
- Receipt semantics: **random receipt_id**, **plan-bound plan_hash**, **idempotent consumption**
- Designed for “solo dev sanity” and CI-grade evidence

---

## What it does

When a change looks dangerous (scope explosion, refactor black hole patterns, dependency churn, etc.),
Decision Assistant returns a **guardrail decision**:

- `ALLOW` — proceed
- `REQUIRE_CONFIRM` — blocked until explicit confirmation + receipt is provided
- `BLOCK` — hard stop (policy threshold exceeded)

In `REQUIRE_CONFIRM`, it returns a **receipt**:

```json
{
  "receipt": {
    "receipt_id": "gr_10af2f50c2ce",
    "plan_hash": "plan_97d4da118562",
    "scope": "this_call_only"
  },
  "confirmation": { "required": true },
  "executed": false
}
```

The user must re-run with:

- `confirm.mode = "EXECUTE"`
- `confirm.receipt_id` (must be reused)
- `confirm.plan_hash` (must match current plan hash)

If the plan changed, the EXECUTE is rejected and a **new receipt** is issued.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

---

## Run semantic tests (receipt norms)

```bash
npm run test:semantics
```

Expected: all tests pass.

---

## Server roundtrip evidence demo (v0.3d)

This repository includes a deterministic “server roundtrip” evidence demo that proves:

1) `REQUIRE_CONFIRM` issues `receipt_id` + `plan_hash`
2) `EXECUTE` succeeds only when the receipt matches the plan hash (and reuses receipt_id)
3) stale confirmations are rejected and re-issued

### One command

```bash
npx tsx demo/demo_server_roundtrip.ts
```

Expected tail marker:

```
PASS: server roundtrip evidence
{ "ok": true, "bundle": "server-roundtrip-evidence", "version": "v0.3d" }
```

### CI-style check

```bash
npx tsx scripts/ci/server_roundtrip_check.ts
```

This fails the process if the evidence marker is missing or any step exits non-zero.

---

## How the demo is structured

- `demo/demo_require_confirm.ts`  
  Finds a signals payload that lands on `REQUIRE_CONFIRM`, prints full payload, and persists:
  - `demo/.demo_last.json` (last run context)
  - `demo/_evidence/1_require_confirm.json` (evidence artifact)

- `demo/demo_execute.ts`  
  Reads `demo/.demo_last.json` (or CLI args) and runs `EXECUTE` with the same receipt.

- `demo/demo_reject.ts`  
  Mutates the signals to force **plan_hash drift**, attempts EXECUTE with stale plan_hash, and validates rejection + reissue.

- `demo/demo_server_roundtrip.ts`  
  Runs all three demos in sequence and prints `PASS: server roundtrip evidence`.

---

## Project boundaries

Decision Assistant (this repo) is intentionally:

- deterministic
- local-first
- “decision infrastructure” for engineering behavior

It is **not**:

- a general LLM agent
- an auto-refactoring tool
- a full product analytics platform

If you want a broader governance + economic measurement layer across multiple decision surfaces,
that belongs in MindForge. Decision Assistant should remain the small, sharp enforcement wedge.

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Key invariants you must not break:

- `assess()` stays **pure** (no fs/git/process/network)
- `receipt_id` must be random, not derived from plan hash or intent
- no extra lifecycle states beyond the normative set
- consumption must be idempotent
